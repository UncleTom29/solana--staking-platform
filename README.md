<p align="center">
    An open protocol for launching liquidity mining programs on Solana.
</p>

## Background

This program was built with the intention of helping more Solana projects launch on-chain liquidity mining programs. It is currently standard for projects to manually send tokens to addresses-- while this is better than no distribution, it would be much better for the growth of the ecosystem if liquidity mining programs were composable and enforceable on-chain.


## Addresses

Program addresses are the same on devnet, testnet, and mainnet-beta.
